# tcp-listener

A very basic TCP server class that accepts a single client, implemented using Windows Sockets 2.  
A sample main.cpp file is included to illustrate how it can be used.  

Similar to [tcp-server](https://github.com/molnar-david/tcp-server), but abstracted into a class form to make it more portable and flexible.

*The tutorial series didn't include a lot of error checking, so most of it I had to look up and write myself*
